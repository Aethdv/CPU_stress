// std is standard library
// std::sync is a Rust standard library module that provides synchronization primitives for safe concurrency, like mutexes, atomic reference counting, and channels.

// Arc is an Atomically Referenced Counter, which allows for safe, shared ownership of data across the threads.
// atomic is a submodule within std::sync that provides atomic types and operations for lock-free thread-safe manipulation of primitive data (like booleans and integers).
// AtomicBool is a boolean that can be safely modified by multiple threads at once.
// Ordering specifies memory ordering constraints for atomic operations.
